This is a work-in-progress
It is mainly a personal project, but I hope one day others will be able to make use of it
It is designed to be a piece of potentially offline software with optional API queries rather than a website
The idea is to make a modifiable weighted graph that users can use to map out different paths routes to run/cycle/walk/move along.
Each connection will be a "stretch", a single path or part of a path.
Each node will be an "intersection",
The user will be able to note down and record lengths of each stretch 
The user will be able to select multiple parts to define a full route.
The user will be able to name and add images to each intersection and stretch to help with recognition.
It will be able to recommend potential stretches using 2 APIs
